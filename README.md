Code and slides for a workshop I hosted at a small KTH machine learning group, showcasing Python and its useful data-processing/machine learning capabilities.

You can [view the slides on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/halflings/data-processing-and-machine-learning-with-python), [download them](https://github.com/halflings/python-data-workshop/blob/master/pydata_slides.pdf) and, *highly recommended*, have a look at the accompanying [IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/halflings/python-data-workshop/blob/master/data-workshop-notebook.ipynb).
